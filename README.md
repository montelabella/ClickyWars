# ClickyWars
A Simple Clicky game using:
*React
*Node.js
*Javascript
*CSS
*HTML

The purpose of the game is to render 21 images to a page for the player to click, However the goal is to NOT click on the same image twice.  
The app keeps the players score and also urges the player to play again.  If the player clicks on an image twice, the game sends a message that you have failed, to try again and will reset the score, however keeping previous score.

There is currenly a bug where if the user manages to click on all 21 images, a win message will not present.  Currently working on that.
