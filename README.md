Clicky Wars

Technologies used:
*React
*Node.js
*HTML
*Javascript
*CSS

This simple "Clicky Game" was created to get a foundation of React.

The games starts with 21 images for the player to click on, The player cannot click on the same image twice or the game is over and the score will reset after a message to the player has displayed.  These images are set to randomly move after each click.

a small bug is when a user is able to click on all 21 cards, currently will not end the game nor will it display a "winner" message.
